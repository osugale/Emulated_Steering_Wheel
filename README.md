# Vitual-steering-wheel-simulator-for-gaming
To enhance our gaming expirence I have come with something new
In this project I have worked on Virtually handling the controls of the the using my hand movements.
The webcam detects the coordination of the hand and based of the coordination it moves the car in the direction of the input

We need to install the Mediapipe and Opencv libraries to make this project work
I have used Mediapipe for the live streaming data input using hand tracking and opencv for image processing and video capturing, you can install them using pip install. 

In this a framework for human hand movement recognition is implemented for users to use/play a driving simulator/game with more immersion and accuracy using a webcam. Here the user shall make hand gesture in a way such that you are using a real car’s steering wheel. Our module will use the webcam to capture the hand’s/fist’s coordinates by calculating the slope whenever the user’s hand gesture gets tilted either left or right, the vehicle in simulator/game will turn accordingly.
